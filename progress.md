# Magic Resize Plugin: Progress Log

## Phase 1: Foundation and Data Capture

### ✅ Feature 1: Node Traversal
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Created a recursive function to traverse all child nodes within a user-selected frame. It successfully logs basic node properties like `type`, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and parent relationships.

### ✅ Feature 2: Basic UI and Interaction
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Developed a simple HTML-based UI for the plugin. Added a button that allows the user to trigger the node traversal function on demand. This separates the logic from running automatically on plugin start.

### ✅ Feature 3: Displaying Results in UI
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Enhanced the UI to display the results of the node traversal directly within the plugin window, providing immediate feedback to the user without needing to check the developer console.

### ✅ Feature 4: Capturing Layout Constraints
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Expanded the traversal logic to capture detailed layout information for each node, as outlined in the design document. This includes:
    - Standard constraints (e.g., `TOP`, `LEFT`, `SCALE`).
    - Auto Layout properties (`layoutMode`, `layoutAlign`, `layoutGrow`).
- **Data Structure:** The captured data is stored in a structured `NodeLayoutData` object for each node, which is then displayed in the UI as a formatted JSON object.

### ✅ Feature 5: Added X/Y Coordinates to UI
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Updated the data capture and UI to explicitly include the `x` and `y` coordinates for each traversed node.

## Phase 2: Resizing Logic

### ✅ Feature 6: Proportional Scaling
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Implemented the core proportional scaling logic. The plugin can now:
    - Take a target width and height from the UI.
    - Clone the selected frame to perform a non-destructive resize.
    - Apply the proportional scaling algorithm (`newX = (oldX / oldWidth) * newWidth`, etc.) to every node within the cloned frame.
- **Reference:** This feature is based on "Pillar 2: Proportional Scaling Algorithm" from the design document.

### ✅ Feature 7: Resize Logging in UI
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Added a logging feature to display the changes made during a resize operation. The UI now shows a detailed, step-by-step log of which elements were moved and resized, including their old and new coordinates and dimensions.

### ✅ Feature 8: Adaptive Text Resizing
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Implemented adaptive resizing for text nodes. During a resize operation, the plugin now:
    - Identifies `TEXT` nodes.
    - Asynchronously loads their fonts.
    - Scales the font size proportionally based on the smaller of the width/height scale factors to ensure readability.
- **Reference:** This feature is based on the principles from "Pillar 3: Smart Text Reflow System."

### ✅ Feature 9: Group-Aware Resizing
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Refactored the resizing logic to be group-aware. Instead of transforming each node individually, the plugin now:
    - Applies a single resize transformation to the top-level cloned frame.
    - Leverages Figma's native hierarchical scaling, which automatically resizes and repositions children within groups while maintaining their relative spacing and layout.
    - A secondary process then traverses the hierarchy to apply adaptive changes (like font scaling) that aren't handled by Figma's native resize.
- **Reference:** This aligns with "Pillar 4: Object Grouping & Priority Layers."

### ✅ Feature 10: Toggleable Resize Strategies
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Added a checkbox to the UI to allow the user to switch between two resizing modes:
    - **Group-Aware Resizing (Default):** The efficient method that leverages Figma's hierarchical scaling. Best for well-structured designs.
    - **Granular Resizing:** The legacy method that resizes each element individually. Can be used as a fallback for designs that don't scale well with the group-aware approach.
- **Rationale:** This provides flexibility, as the effectiveness of group-aware resizing can depend on how the original design is constructed.

### ✅ Feature 11: Content-Aware Image Resizing
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Implemented a heuristic-based approach for resizing images to prevent distortion. When resizing, the plugin now:
    - Detects nodes with image fills.
    - Calculates the correct scale to make the image "cover" its container, preserving the aspect ratio.
    - Centers the image within its container, effectively creating a center-weighted crop.
- **Reference:** This aligns with the principles of "Pillar 5: Content-Aware Image Cropping."

### ✅ Feature 12: Adaptive Stroke Resizing (and Logic Refactor)
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Added a new feature to intelligently handle vector strokes during upscaling. The plugin now has a toggle for "Adaptive Stroke Resizing," which prevents strokes from becoming disproportionately thick.
- **Refactor Note:** As part of this update, the buggy "Group-Aware Resizing" feature was removed. The plugin now uses a single, more reliable resizing method that correctly scales all elements, including nested vectors and groups. This simplifies the UI and improves predictability.

### ✅ Feature 13: Boundary Clamping
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Added a safety feature to ensure that no elements are positioned outside of their parent's boundaries after a resize. The plugin now automatically clamps the final X and Y coordinates of each node, preventing visual overflow and keeping the layout tidy.

### ✅ Feature 12: Granular Resize Controls
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Added individual toggles in the UI for all major resizing features, giving the user fine-grained control over the process. The available options are:
    - **Group-Aware Resizing**
    - **Adaptive Text Resizing**
    - **Content-Aware Image Resizing**
- **Rationale:** This allows users to disable specific features that may not work well with a particular design, increasing the plugin's flexibility.
