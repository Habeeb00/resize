# Magic Resize Plugin: Progress Log

## Phase 1: Foundation and Data Capture

### ✅ Feature 1: Node Traversal
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Created a recursive function to traverse all child nodes within a user-selected frame. It successfully logs basic node properties like `type`, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and parent relationships.

### ✅ Feature 2: Basic UI and Interaction
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Developed a simple HTML-based UI for the plugin. Added a button that allows the user to trigger the node traversal function on demand. This separates the logic from running automatically on plugin start.

### ✅ Feature 3: Displaying Results in UI
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Enhanced the UI to display the results of the node traversal directly within the plugin window, providing immediate feedback to the user without needing to check the developer console.

### ✅ Feature 4: Capturing Layout Constraints
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Expanded the traversal logic to capture detailed layout information for each node, as outlined in the design document. This includes:
    - Standard constraints (e.g., `TOP`, `LEFT`, `SCALE`).
    - Auto Layout properties (`layoutMode`, `layoutAlign`, `layoutGrow`).
- **Data Structure:** The captured data is stored in a structured `NodeLayoutData` object for each node, which is then displayed in the UI as a formatted JSON object.

### ✅ Feature 5: Added X/Y Coordinates to UI
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Description:** Updated the data capture and UI to explicitly include the `x` and `y` coordinates for each traversed node.
